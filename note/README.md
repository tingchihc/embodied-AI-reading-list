1. <b>Summary</b>: The paper review should first summarize the entire paper. This means first explaining what the paper is trying to do and how the paper proposes to do it. Your summary should focus on the primary novelty and contributions of the paper, rather than unimportant details. Your summary of the paper typically will include a summary of a new model architecture or loss function but might also involve describing key mathematical insights which undergird the paper. If the primary contribution of the paper is a dataset, the paper should describe details about what makes the dataset significant. Your summary should also summarize how the method is experimentally evaluated and any significant findings or results, whether quantitative or qualitative.
2. <b>Relation to prior work</b>: The review should next summarize the paper’s relation to prior work and why its contributions are (or are not) significant in your opinion. Reading the paper’s “Related Work” section and understanding how the paper differs from prior work will help you write this section.
3. <b>Strengths</b>: The review should mention at least three strengths of the approach. For example, you might explain how a particular technique or design is expected to solve problems with existing work. Simply rephrasing the strengths of the paper from its contribution section does not adequately address this point. Instead, rely on your own impression of the work and your own judgments about its novelty.  
4. <b>Weaknesses</b>: What do you feel detracts from the paper’s contributions? Your review should mention at least three weaknesses. Some example weaknesses include cases where the method is likely to not perform well because of its design, computational costs, non-standard inference or train requirements, shortcomings in the proposed loss function or formulation, or a weak experimental evaluation.  
5. <b>Future work</b>: Propose at least one possible extension of the paper. This might be a fix to a weakness you identified (e.g. a modified model or loss function) or you might propose how the techniques developed in the paper could be applied in some novel way for a different task. You should not, however, simply rephrase or repeat the future work suggested by the paper itself. Instead, think critically about how you might extend the paper as a researcher.
